The movie features Matt, Pepe's creator, his partner, his friends as well as a handful of other individuals who played a significant roll throughout Pepe's memetic journey. It follows a linear progression of Pepe's story, Matt's struggles to reclaim him, the numerous ups and downs as well as the legal battles Matt had to face.

It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.

The movie earned critical acclaim. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 95% approval rating, with a 7.7/10 rating.

> _"Jones' movie is a beacon of internet literacy about a whole new languageâ€”that memes are flexible, omnipotent, and pieces of a phenomenon more powerful than their creators." -_ Nick Allen of [RegerEbert.com](https://www.rogerebert.com/)

It was also described as the "most important political film of 2020" by Vox Media's [Polygon](https://www.polygon.com/).
